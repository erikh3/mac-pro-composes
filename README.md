## Run everything

The optional services are using [compose profiles](https://docs.docker.com/compose/how-tos/profiles/) and
containers won't be created unless at least one of their profiles is activated.

The default profiles & other environment variables are pre-filled in `.env` file.

```shell
docker compose up -d
```

Enable profiles explicitly:

```shell
docker compose --profile webtop up -d
```
